# Appointment Scheduler

## SCENARIO
You are working for a software company that has been contracted to develop a GUI-based scheduling desktop application. The contract is with a global consulting organization that conducts business in multiple languages and has main offices in Phoenix, Arizona; White Plains, New York; Montreal, Canada; and London, England. The consulting organization has provided a MySQL database that the application must pull data from. The database is used for other systems, so its structure cannot be modified.

## USAGE
When running the application the user will be initially prompted with a login page. Depending on the user's language settings on their computer the login page will either be in English or French. To enter the application the user can login by entering "test" or "admin" into the the credentials for both username & password <br/> <br/>

<br/>

Once the application has been logged into, it will prompt the user with a warning message stating whether or not the user has an appointment within 15 minutes of logging in. It will also populate the table and display the data of all the customers that have been entered into the database. It is on this page that the user may manage customer data including add/edit/deleting customer data from the database. <br/> <br/>

The user can then navigate to the appointment directory where they can add/edit/delete appointments for customers, and also filter the appointments by week or month.<br/><br/>
